Fresh Objects:

Fresh objects refer to the most recent or up-to-date version of data or information.
In caching, a fresh object is one that has been recently accessed or fetched from the original data source. It reflects the latest state of the data.
Freshness is typically desirable, as it ensures that the cached data is current and accurate.
However, maintaining freshness can come with challenges such as ensuring timely updates and managing cache invalidation.

Stale Objects:

Stale objects are outdated or no longer valid versions of data or information.
In caching, a stale object is one that has not been updated to reflect the most recent changes in the original data source.
Staleness can occur when cached data is not regularly refreshed or when updates to the original data source are not immediately propagated to the cache.
Stale data can lead to inconsistencies and inaccuracies, especially in systems where data changes frequently.
